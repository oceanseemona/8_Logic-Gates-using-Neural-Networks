# Logic-Gates-using-Neural-Networks

OBJECTIVE:

â€¢ To implement logic gates using neural networks

INSTALL:

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed :-

>NumPy
command prompt: pip install numpy

>Matplotlib
command prompt: pip install matplotlib

>Jupyter Notebook
command prompt: pip install jupyter

If Python is not installed yet, Anaconda distribution of Python can also be used, which already has the above packages.

OUTPUT:
